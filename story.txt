On a cold October night, I got into my bratwurst-colored Porsche. On my way to the biergarten, Rammstein was blasting on the radio. The best musik that could be heard from Munich to Berlin. I spilled mustard from my Bratwurst on my Lederhosen. Then I got on the train to Berlin to visit the schloss. I could barely stand because I had eaten too much brot and could barely fit into my lederhose. Looking out the window, it started to rain, there was a gentle whirr of the Klimaanlage, and I saw the tinkling lights of a Flugzeug in the distance.
