On a cold October night, I got into my bratwurst-colored Porsche. On my way to the biergarten, Rammstein was blasting on the radio. The best musik that could be heard from Munich to Berlin. I spilled mustard from my Bratwurst on my Lederhosen. Then I got on the train to Berlin to visit the schloss. I could barely stand because I had eaten too much brot and could barely fit into my lederhose. Looking out the window, it started to rain, there was a gentle whirr of the Klimaanlage, and I saw the tinkling lights of a Flugzeug in the distance. I knew that it meant I was near the Raesfeld flughafen.Traveling the bumpy Hauptstrasse to the airport, I spilled Hefeweizen all over my frankfurter-colored car interior.  At that point I had had enough and decided to just return to the biergarten and drink away my sorrows.
